  <p>Since the year 2010, Tathva International School has been offering the highest quality education for students aged 3 to
    6 through the International Preschool Curriculum (IPC) and the world renowned Cambridge Curriculum. These curriculums
    are designed for a thematic-based and fun learning experience for children in all academic stages of life. </p>
  <p>
    The Kindergarten comprises three grades. First time learners, ages 3 to 4, are placed in Cubs. In this group, students are
    introduced to new and exciting themes such as “Under the Sea”, “Money, Shops and Jobs”, “Around the World” and many more!
    The Cubs students learn skills related to social skills, fine and gross motor skills, phonics and numbers. This stage
    is very important, building a solid foundation for the child to build upon.

  </p>
  <p>
    The next level is Pandas. This group consists of ages 4 to 5 and focuses on further honing their motor skills, numeracy,
    and phonics. Pandas learn three-letter sight words (CVC) and simple sentences using the vocabulary they’ve attained.
    Still using the IPC, this group experiences new themes such as “Who Am I”, “Health, Safety, and Hygiene”, “At The Farm”
    and more! Pandas have lots of fun while learning more about themselves and the wonderful world we live in through interactive
    lessons and discussions.

    The final stage for Tathva International Kindergarten is the Dolphins class. Dolphins no longer use the IPC, but instead
    follow the Cambridge Stage One. Dolphins focus more strongly on academic topics in phonics, math and science! Even though
    they do not follow the IPC curriculum, Dolphins have fun learning about themes such as “Five Senses”, “Our Universe”,
    “Flowers and Plants” and so much more! This class not only prepares your child for a wonderful future with the Cambridge
    Accredited Primary Grades, but also gives them the opportunity to explore skills and life in a fun and exciting manner!
  </p>
  <p>
    Each of the grade levels in Kindergarten takes part in field trips, end-of-the-month theme parties, show and tell, community
    service week, holiday celebrations, Autumn Fair, Winter Concert, and Annual Day, during which we showcase the students’
    coordination and musical abilities. Tathva International Kindergarten keeps a full and exciting schedule for students,
    parents, and community members alike.
  </p>
  <p>
    It may seem like a lot to be done, but with the help of our nurturing and dedicated staff, supportive and structured class-environment,
    and wonderful curriculums, every student is given the opportunity to focus on learning, as well as social development.
    We believe our students should not only learn, but also grow as people and grow with the rest of us together as a team.
