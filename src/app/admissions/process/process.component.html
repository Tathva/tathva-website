<h1 class="content-title">Admission Policy Information</h1>
<div class="section text-item">
    <h2>English as a Second Language</h2>
    <p>Students with limited English ability will be accepted on a case-by-case decision, depending on the space-availability
        and prior educational experiences.
    </p>
    <p>ESL students can be accepted with no knowledge of English up to Grade 5, provided they have a strong academic background
        and if the student performs well in our assessment test.
    </p>
    <p>At least one of the parents should be able to speak and read English, as all school correspondences will be conducted
        in English only. If neither of the parents are able to speak English, they must bring their own interpreter each
        time. The school will not divulge any information to another parent if brought as an interpreter.

    <p>All students accepted to Tathva International School are expected to function in the regular classroom independently.
    </p>
    <p>It is important to note that the ongoing enrollment at Tathva International School for students will be based upon the
        students’ ability to function within the regular program.
    </p>
    <p>Tathva International School does not have the facilities or resources to accommodate children who have significant learning,
        emotional or physical disabilities. Parents of a child receiving any special services, such as learning disabled
        instruction, remedial support, speech/language therapy, occupational/physical therapy, behavioral support, or seeing
        any educational specialist outside of the regular classroom, must disclose the additional services that are being
        implemented with your child. Supporting documentation from a school psychologist, previous school, and/or pediatrician
        may be requested by administration to complete the admission process and/or continue at Tathva International School.
